      "The invention of the smartphone is a bit complex, as it involved the contributions of many individuals and companies over several decades. However, I can give you an overview of the key players and milestones that led to the development of modern smartphones.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Early beginnings:**\n",
      "The first mobile phone was invented by Martin Cooper, an engineer at Motorola, in 1973. Cooper made the first public call on a handheld mobile phone on April 3, 1973, calling a rival telecommunications company to declare that he was speaking from a cell phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The first smartphone:**\n",
      "The first smartphone is often credited to IBM, which released the IBM Simon Personal Communicator in 1994. This device had a touchscreen display, email, fax, and phone capabilities, as well as a calendar and address book. It was a bulky device that weighed around 18 ounces and had a price tag of $999.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The modern smartphone:**\n",
      "The modern smartphone as we know it today was popularized by Apple's iPhone, which was released in 2007. The iPhone was the brainchild of Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder and CEO at the time. The iPhone introduced a multi-touch interface, a mobile app store, and a sleek design that revolutionized the smartphone industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Other key players:**\n",
      "Other companies and individuals also played important roles in the development of smartphones, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Nokia, which released the Nokia 9000 Communicator in 1996, a device that combined phone, email, and web browsing capabilities.\n",
      "* BlackBerry, which introduced the first smartphone with a physical keyboard and email capabilities in 1999.\n",
      "* Google, which developed the Android operating system, which is now used by many smartphone manufacturers.\n",
      "* Samsung, which has become one of the largest smartphone manufacturers in the world, releasing a wide range of Android-based devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while it is difficult to attribute the invention of the smartphone to a single person, Martin Cooper, IBM, and Apple's Steve Jobs are some of the key figures who contributed to the development of modern smartphones.\n"
